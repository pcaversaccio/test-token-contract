/**
 * @title Test token contract
 * @author Pascal Marco Caversaccio, pascal@alethena.com
 * @dev These tokens are based on the ERC20 standard and the open-zeppelin library.
 *
 * These tokens are uncertified alethena shares (Wertrechte according to the Swiss code of obligations),
 * with this smart contract serving as onwership registry (Wertrechtebuch), but not as shareholder
 * registry, which is kept separate and run by the company. This is equivalent to the traditional system
 * of having physical share certificates kept at home by the shareholders and a shareholder registry run by
 * the company. Just like with physical certificates, the owners of the tokens are the owners of the shares.
 * However, in order to exercise their rights (for example receive a dividend), shareholders must register
 * with the company. For example, in case the company pays out a dividend to a previous shareholder because
 * the current shareholder did not register, the company cannot be held liable for paying the dividend to
 * the "wrong" shareholder. In relation to the company, only the registered shareholders count as such.
 * Registration requires setting up an account with ledgy.com providing your name and address and proving
 * ownership over your addresses.
 * @notice The main addition is a functionality that allows the user to claim that the key for a certain address is lost.
 * @notice In order to prevent malicious attempts, a collateral needs to be posted.
 * @notice The contract owner can delete claims in case of disputes.
 *
